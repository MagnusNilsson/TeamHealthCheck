An attempt to review a team, based on https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/. Meaning and impact have been merged to a single area, leaving four areas with four questions each.

## Approach
Personal interview with each team member. Quantify each question 1-5, and calculate the team average for each area.

Both the quantitative and the qualitative results are of interest - the numbers to compare with previous measurements, and the sentiments on what could be improved, and how.

The team is the main group of people with which you work. Make sure that this is properly defined for each health check.

## Psychological Safety, Trust
**What is this?**
Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed? Is it safe to share ideas and solutions? Can you have healthy discussions, where any conflicts are resolved with no hard feelings? Can you allow yourself to feel vulnerable in front of the team? Is there a fear of conflict, or artificial harmony?

**Questions**
1. Do you feel it’s safe to share your ideas in team meetings? 1 (no) - 5 (yes, it’s safe)
2. Do you feel like your contribution is valued equally to other team members? 1 - 5
3. Do you feel like you can show vulnerability in front of the team, e.g. show that you don’t know something, or that you changed your mind after reading up on a subject? 1-5 
4. Do you think that the team is capable of settling differing opinions in a healthy way, without lingering bad feelings? 1 (no) - 5 (capable)
